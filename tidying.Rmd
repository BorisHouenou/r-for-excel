# Tidying

## Summary

In previous sessions, we learned to read in data, do some wrangling, and create a graph and table. 

Here, we'll continue by *reshaping* data frames (converting from long-to-wide, or wide-to-long format), *separating* and *uniting* variable (column) contents, finding and replacing string patterns, and isolating numbers from number-character combinations.

## Objectives

- Reshape data frames with `tidyr::pivot_wider()` and `tidyr::pivot_longer()`
- Convert column names with `janitor::clean_names()`
- Combine or separate information from columns with `tidyr::unite()` and `tidyr::separate()`
- Detect a string with `stringr::str_detect()`
- Replace a string with `stringr::str_replace()`
- Isolate numbers with `readr::parse_number()`
- Use our new skills as part of a bigger wrangling sequence

## Resources

-- [Ch. 12 *Tidy Data*, in R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html) by Grolemund & Wickham

## Set-up

### Create a new R Markdown and attach packages

Within your day 2 R Project, create a new .Rmd. Attach the following packages (using `library(package_name)`): 

- `tidyverse`
- `here`
- `janitor` 
- `readxl` 
- `kableExtra`

Knit and save your new .Rmd within the project folder. 

```{r, include = FALSE}
# Attach packages
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(here)
library(readxl)
library(kableExtra)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Attach packages
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(here)
library(readxl)
library(kableExtra)
```

### Read in data with `read_excel()`

We've used both `read_csv()` and `read_excel()` to import data from spreadsheets into R. 

Use `read_excel()` to read in the **inverts.xlsx** data as an objected called **inverts**.

```{r, message = FALSE}
inverts <- read_excel(here("data", "inverts.xlsx"))
```

Be sure to explore the imported data a bit: 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
View(inverts)
names(inverts)
summary(inverts)
```

## Wide-to-longer format with `tidyr::pivot_longer()`

In *tidy format*, each variable is contained within a single column. If we look at *inverts_df*, we can see that the *year* variable is actually split over 3 columns, so we'd say this is currently in **wide format**. 

There may be times when you want to have data in wide format, but often with code it is more efficient to convert to **long format** by gathering together observations for a variable that is currently split into multiple columns. 

Schematically, converting from wide to long format looks like this: 

![](img/tidyr_pivot_longer.png)

We'll use `tidyr::pivot_longer()` to gather data from all years in *inverts* (columns `2016`, `2017`, and `2018`) into two columns: 

- one called *year*, which contains the year (as a number)
- one called *sp_count* containing the number of each species observed. 

The new data frame will be stored as *inverts_long*:

```{r}

inverts_long <- pivot_longer(data = inverts, 
                                    cols = '2016':'2018',
                                    names_to = "year",
                                    values_to = "sp_count")

```

The outcome is the new long-format *inverts_long* data frame:
```{r}
inverts_long
```

Hooray, long format! 

One thing that isn't obvious at first (but would become obvious if you continued working with this data) is that since those year numbers were initially column names (characters), when they are stacked into the *year* column, their class wasn't auto-updated to numeric. 

Explore the class of *year* in *inverts_long*:

```{r}
class(inverts_long$year)
```

We'll use `dplyr::mutate()` in a different way here: to create a new column (that's how we've used `mutate()` previously) that has the same name of an existing column, in order to update and overwrite the existing column. 

In this case, we'll `mutate()` to add a column called *year*, which contains an `as.numeric()` version of the existing *year* variable: 

```{r}

# Coerce "year" class to numeric: 

inverts_long <- inverts_long %>% 
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year))

```

Checking the class again, we see that *year* has been updated to a numeric variable:

```{r}
class(inverts_long$year)
```

## Long-to-wider format with `tidyr::pivot_wider()`

In the previous example, we had information spread over multiple columns that we wanted to *gather*. Sometimes, we'll have data that we want to *spread* over multiple columns. 

For example, imagine that starting from *inverts_long* we want each species in the *common_name* column to exist as its **own column**. In that case, we would be converting from a longer to a wider format, and will use `tidyr::pivot_wider()`.

Specifically for our data, we'll use `pivot_wider()` to spread the *common_name* across multiple columns as follows: 

```{r}
inverts_wide <- inverts_long %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = common_name, 
                     values_from = sp_count)
```

```{r}
inverts_wide
```

We can see that now each *species* has its own column (wider format). But also notice that those column headers (since they have spaces) might not be in the most coder-friendly format...

## Clean up column names with `janitor::clean_names()`

The `janitor` package by Sam Firke is a brilliant collection of functions for some quick data cleaning. We recommend that you explore the different functions it contains. Like:

- `janitor::clean_names()`: update column headers to a case of your choosing
- `janitor::get_dupes()`: see all rows that are duplicates within variables you choose
- `janitor::remove_empty()`: remove empty rows and/or columns
- `janitor::adorn_*()`: jazz up frequency tables of counts (we'll return to this for a table example in TODO: Session 8)

Here, we'll use `janitor::clean_names()` to convert all of our column headers to a more convenient case - the default is **lower_snake_case**, which means all spaces and symbols are replaced with an underscore (or a word describing the symbol), all characters are lowercase, and a few other nice adjustments. 

For example, `janitor::clean_names()` would update these nightmare column names into much nicer forms:

- `My...RECENT-income!` becomes `my_recent_income`
- `SAMPLE2.!test1` becomes `sample2_test1`
- `ThisIsTheName` becomes `this_is_the_name`
- `2015` becomes `x2015`

If we wanted to then use these columns (which we probably would, since we created them), we could clean the names to get them into more coder-friendly lower_snake_case with `janitor::clean_names()`:

```{r}
inverts_wide <- inverts_wide %>% 
  clean_names()
```

```{r}
names(inverts_wide)
```

And there are other case options in `clean_names()`, like: 

- "snake" produces snake_case (the default)
- "lower_camel" or "small_camel" produces lowerCamel
- "upper_camel" or "big_camel" produces UpperCamel
- "screaming_snake" or "all_caps" produces ALL_CAPS
- "lower_upper" produces lowerUPPER
- "upper_lower" produces UPPERlower

## Combine or separate columns with `tidyr::unite()` and `tidyr::separate()`

Sometimes we'll want to *separate* contents of a single column into multiple columns, or *combine* entries from different columns into a single column. 

For example, the following data frame has *genus* and *species* in separate columns:
```{r, echo = FALSE, eval=FALSE}
unite_ex <- tribble(
  ~id, ~genus, ~species, ~common_name,
  1, "Scorpaena", "guttata", "sculpin",
  2, "Sebastes", "miniatus", "vermillion"
)

kable(unite_ex)
```

We may want to combine the genus and species into a single column, *scientific_name*: 
```{r, echo = FALSE, eval=FALSE}
unite_ex_sci_name <- unite_ex %>% 
  unite("scientific_name", 
        c(genus, species),
        sep = " ")

kable(unite_ex_sci_name)
```

Or we may want to do the reverse (separate information from a single column into multiple columns). Here, we'll learn `tidyr::unite()` and `tidyr::separate()` to help us do both. 

### `tidyr::unite()` to merge information from separate columns

Use `tidyr::unite()` to combine information from multiple columns into a single column (as for the scientific name example above)

![](img/rstudio-cheatsheet-unite.png)

To demonstrate uniting information from separate columns, we'll make a single column that has the combined information from *site* abbreviation and *year* in *inverts_wide*. 

We need to give `tidyr::unite()` several arguments:

- **data:** the data frame containing columns we want to combine (or pipe into the function from the data frame)
- **col:** the name of the new "united" column
- the **columns you are uniting**
- **sep:** the symbol, value or character to put between the united information from each column

```{r}

inverts_unite <- inverts_wide %>% 
  unite(col = "site_year", # What to name the new united column
               c(site, year), # The columns we'll unite (site, year)
               sep = "_") # How to separate the things we're uniting

```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
head(inverts_unite)
```

Try updating the separator from "_" to "_hello!_" to see what the outcome column contains.

`tidyr::unite()` can also combine information from *more* than two columns. For example, to combine the *site*, *common_name* and *year* columns from *inverts_long*, we could use:

```{r}

# Uniting more than 2 columns: 

inverts_triple_unite <- inverts_long %>% 
  tidyr::unite(col = "year_site_name",
               c(year, site, common_name),
               sep = "-") # Note: this is a dash

```

```{r}
head(inverts_triple_unite)
```

### `tidyr::separate()` to separate information into multiple columns

While `tidyr::unite()` allows us to combine information from multiple columns, it's more likely that you'll *start* with a single column that you want to split up into pieces.

For example, I might want to split up a column containing the *genus* and *species* (*Scorpaena guttata*) into two separate columns (*Scorpaena* | *guttata*), so that I can count how many *Scorpaena* organisms exist in my dataset at the genus level. 

Use `tidyr::separate()` to "separate a character column into multiple columns using a regular expression separator." 

![](img/rstudio-cheatsheet-separate.png)

Let's start again with *inverts_unite*, where we have combined the *site* and *year* into a single column called *site_year*. If we want to **separate** those, we can use:

```{r}

inverts_sep <- inverts_triple_unite %>% 
  tidyr::separate(year_site_name, into = c("my_year", "my_site_name"))

```

What is that warning `Expected 2 pieces...` telling us? If we take a look at the resulting data frame *inverts_sep*, we see that it only keeps the first **two** pieces, and gets rid of the third (name). Which is a bit concerning, because we rarely want to just throw away information in a data frame. 

```{r}
head(inverts_sep)
```

That's problematic. How can we make sure we're keeping as many different elements as exist in the united column? 

We have a couple of options: 

1. Create the *number* of columns that are needed to retain as many elements as exist (in this case, 3, but we only created two new columns in the example above)

```{r}
inverts_sep3 <- inverts_triple_unite %>% 
  tidyr::separate(year_site_name, into = c("the_year", "the_site", "the_name"))
```

Another warning. What is that about? Let's take a look at the resulting data frame and think about what's missing (what are the "pieces discarded"?):

```{r}
head(inverts_sep3)
```


Aha! Only the *first word* of the common name was retained, and anything else was trashed. We want to keep everything after the second dash in the new *the_name* column. 

That's because the **default is `extra = "warn"`**, which means that if you have more pieces than columns you're separating into, it will populate the columns that have been allotted (in our case, just 3) then drop any additional information, giving you a warning that pieces have been dropped.

To keep the extra pieces that have been dropped, add the `extra = "merge"` argument within `tidyr::separate()` to override:

```{r}
inverts_sep_all <- inverts_triple_unite %>% 
  separate(year_site_name, 
           into = c("sample_year", "location", "sp_name"), 
           extra = "merge")
```

No warning there about things being discarded. Explore *inverts_sep_all*:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
inverts_sep_all
```

We see that the resulting data frame has split *year_site_name* into three separate columns, *sample_year*, *location*, and *sp_name*, but now everything after the second break ("-") remains together in *sp_name* instead of dropping pieces following the third word. 

## Get just the numbers with `readr::parse_number()`

Sometimes, data are entered in a way that combines numeric information with other character bits. Like: 

- 152.4 grams
- $ 800.23
- 54.6 %
- mass 458.9 lbs

But usually, we want to work with the numeric piece on its own.

**Note: keep that in mind for data entry - it's good to include units, symbols, and descriptive characters, but include them in a separate column, and/or in metadata!**

We can isolate *just* the numeric part of an entry using `readr::parse_number()`. 

As an example, let's return to the **inverts_unite** object we created previously. Let's say that we want to create a new column that contains only the numeric part from **site_year**. 

We could use `parse_number()` as follows: 
```{r}
parse_yr <- inverts_unite %>% 
  mutate(
    year_num = parse_number(site_year)
  )
```

Notice that **parse_yr** now has an additional column, year, which only contains the numeric piece from the **site_year** column. Cool! 

## Detecting a string pattern with `stringr::str_detect()`

Sometimes we'll want to find observations that contain a specific string pattern within a variable of interest. 

For example, consider the fantasy data below:

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval=FALSE}

df_str_ex <- tribble(
  ~id, ~species,
  1, "rainbow rockfish",
  2, "blue rockfish",
  3, "sparkle urchin",
  4, "royal blue fish"
)

kable(df_str_ex)

```

There might be a time when we would want to use observations that:

- Contain the string "fish", in isolation or within a larger string (like "rockfish")
- Contain the string "blue"

In those cases, it would be useful to **detect** a string pattern. Here, we'll use `stringr::str_detect()` to find and keep observations that contain our specified string pattern. 

Refamiliarize yourself with the **inverts** object:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
View(inverts)
```

First, we want to detect observations where the **site** variable contains string pattern "sc". Note that there are two sites that contain the pattern: **scdi** and **sctw**. 

Using `str_detect()` to find and keep observations where the **site** variable contains pattern "sc":
```{r}
sc_detect <- inverts %>% 
  filter(
    str_detect(site, pattern = "sc")
  )

# Use `unique` to return the unique entries in the site column:
unique(sc_detect$site)
```

We see that only sites **scdi** and **sctw** remain in **sc_detect**. 

### Activity

Create a new object called **in_detect**, starting from **inverts**, that only contains observations if the **common_name** variable contains the string pattern "in".

What species remain?

Solution:
```{r}
in_detect <- inverts %>% 
  filter(
    str_detect(common_name, pattern = "in")
  )

unique(in_detect$common_name)

# Only 'california spiny lobster' and 'purple urchin' remain!
```

We can similarly choose to *exclude* observations that contain a set string pattern by adding the `negate = TRUE` argument within `str_detect()`. 

For example, to exclude any observations where the common name contains "california," we'd use:
```{r}
no_ca <- inverts %>% 
  filter(
    str_detect(common_name, pattern = "california", negate = TRUE)
  )
```

Look at **no_ca** to confirm that "california spiny lobster" and "california cone snail" have been excluded.

## Replacing a string with `stringr::str_replace()`

Was data entered in a way that's difficult to code with, or is just plain annoying? Did someone wrongly enter "fish" as "fsh" throughout the spreadsheet, and you want to update it everywhere? 

Use `stringr::str_replace()` to automatically replace a string pattern. 

**Warning**: The pattern will be replaced everywhere - so if you ask to replace "fsh" with "fish", then "offshore" would be updated to "offishore". Be careful to ensure that when you think you're making one replacement, you're not also replacing something else unexpectedly. 

Starting with inverts, let's any place we find "california" we want to replace it with the abbreviation "CA":

```{r}
ca_abbr <- inverts %>% 
  mutate(
    common_name = 
      str_replace(common_name, 
              pattern = "california", 
              replacement = "CA")
  )
```

Now, check to confirm that "california" has been replaced with "CA".
