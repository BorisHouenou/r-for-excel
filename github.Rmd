## Summary 

We will learn about version control and practice a workflow with GitHub and RStudio that streamlines working with our most important collaborator: Future You. 

### Objectives

Today, we'll interface with GitHub from our local computers using RStudio. 

> **Aside**: There are many other ways to interact with GitHub, including GitHub's Desktop App and the command line ([here is Jenny Bryan's list of git clients](http://stat545.com/git02_git-clients.html)). You have the largest suite of options if you interface through the command line, but the most common things you'll do can be done through one of these other applications (i.e. RStudio).

Here's what we'll do, since we've already set up git on your computers in the previous session (Chapter \@ref(github)): 

1. create a repository on Github.com
1. clone locally using RStudio 
1. syncing to GitHub.com: pull, stage, commit, push
1. explore github.com files, commit history, README
1. project-oriented workflows
1. project-oriented workflows in action

### Resources

Today, we'll only introduce the features and terminology that new R users need to learn to begin managing their projects.


## Why should R users use Github?

TODO: refine

1. Ends (or, nearly ends) the horror of keeping track of versions.
  Basically, we get away from this: 
<br />
<br />
![](img/MessySaves.png)
<br />
<br />
When you open your repository, you only see the most recent version.  But, it easy to compare versions, and you can easily revert to previous versions. 
<br />
<br />
2. Improves collaborative efforts.  Different researchers can work on the same files at the same time!
3. It is easy to share and distribute files through the Github website.
4. Your files are available anywhere, you just need internet connection!  

### What are Git and Github?

- **Git** is a version control system that lets you track changes to files over time. These files can be any kind of file (eg .doc, .pdf, .xls), but free text differences are most easily visible (eg txt, csv, md). 

- **Github** is a website for storing your git versioned files remotely. It has many nice features to be able visualize differences between [images](https://help.github.com/articles/rendering-and-diffing-images/), [rendering](https://help.github.com/articles/mapping-geojson-files-on-github/) & [diffing](https://github.com/blog/1772-diffable-more-customizable-maps) map data files, [render text data files](https://help.github.com/articles/rendering-csv-and-tsv-data/), and [track changes in text](https://help.github.com/articles/rendering-differences-in-prose-documents/).

You can sign up for the student account [here](https://education.github.com/pack).  Instructors can also request a free organization [account, "Request a discount"](https://education.github.com/).
--->

Github was developed for social coding (i.e., sort of like an open source Wikipedia for programmers). Consequently, much of the functionality and terminology of Github (e.g., branches and pull requests) isn't necessary for a new R user getting started.  

These concepts are more important for coders who want the entire coding community (and not just people working on the same project) to be able to suggest changes to their code.  This isn't how most new R users will use Github.  

To get the full functionality of Github, you will eventually want to learn other concepts. But, this can wait.  

### Some Github terminology

* **User**: A Github account for you (e.g., jules32).
* **Organization**: The Github account for one or more user (e.g., datacarpentry).
* **Repository**: A folder within the organization that includes files dedicated to a project.
* **Local Github**: Copies of Github files located your computer.
* **Remote Github**: Github files located on the https://github.com website.
* **Clone**: Process of making a local copy of a remote Github repository.  This only needs to be done once (unless you mess up your local copy).
* **Pull**: Copy changes on the remote Github repository to your local Github repository.  This is useful if multiple people are making changes to a repository.
* **Push**: Save local changes to remote Github

## Create a repository on Github.com

First, go to your account on github.com. Notice that the URL is github.com/your-username.

Click "New repository".

<br>

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/gh_repo_create.png")  
```

<br>

Choose a name. Call it whatever you want (the shorter the better), or follow me for convenience. I will call mine `r-workshop`. 

Also, add a description, make it public, create a README file, and create your repo!

<br>

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/gh_repo_create2.png")  
```

<br>

The *Add gitignore* option adds a document where you can identify files or file-types you want Github to ignore. These files will stay in on the local Github folder (the one on your computer), but will not be uploaded onto the web version of Github.

The *Add a license* option adds a license that describes how other people can use your Github files (e.g., open source, but no one can profit from them, etc.).  We won't worry about this today.

Check out our new repository!  


<br>

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/gh_repo_new.png")  
```

<br>

Great! So now we have our new repository that exists in the Cloud. Let's get it established locally on our computers: that is called "cloning". 

## Clone your repository using RStudio

Let's clone this repo to our local computer using RStudio. Unlike downloading, cloning keeps all the version control and user information bundled with the files. 

<!---
**Step 0**: Create your `github` folder 

This is really important! We need to be organized and deliberate about where we want to keep all of our GitHub repositories (since this is the first of many in your career). 

Let's all make a folder called `github` (all lowercase!) in our home directories. So it will look like this: 

- Windows: `Users\[User]\Documents\github\`
- Mac: `Users/[User]/github/`

This will let us take advantage of something that is really key about GitHub.com: you can easily navigate through folders within repositories and the urls reflect this navigation. The greatness of this will be evident soon. So let's set ourselves up for easily translating (and remembering) those navigation paths by having a folder called `github` that will serve as our 'github.com'.

So really. Make sure that you have an all-lowercase folder called `github` in your home directory!!

--->

### Copy the repo address 

First, copy the web address of the repository you want to clone. (By default this is HTTPS, but you could alternatively set up with SSH. This is more advanced than we will get into here, but allows 2-factor authentication. See [Happy Git with R](https://happygitwithr.com/credential-caching.html#special-consideration-re-two-factor-authentication) for more information.)

<br>

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/gh_repo_clone1.png")  
```

<br>

### RStudio: New Project

Now go back to RStudio, and click on New Project. There are a few different ways; you could also go to File > New Project..., or click the little green + with the R box in the top left.
also in the File menu).

<br>

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/new_project1.png")  
```

<br>


### Select Version Control

<br>

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/new_project2.png")  
```

<br>

### Select Git

Since we are using git. 

<br>

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/new_project3.png")  
```

<br>


### Paste the repo address

Paste the repo address (which is still in your clipboard) into in the "Repository URL" field. The "Project directory name" should autofill; if it does not press *tab*, or type it in. It is best practice to keep the "Project directory name" **THE SAME** as the repository name.

When cloned, this repository is going to become a folder on your computer. 

At this point you can save this repo anywhere. There are different schools of thought but we think it is useful to create a high-level folder where you will keep your github repos to keep them organized. We call ours `github` and keep it in our root folder (`~/github`), and so that is what we will demonstrate here â€” you are welcome to do the same. Press "Browse..." to navigate to a folder and you have the option of creating a new folder. 

Save it in your github folder (click on Browse) to do this. 

<br>

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/new_project4.png")  
```

<br>


### Admire your local repo

If everything went well, the repository will show up in RStudio!

<br>

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/new_project5.png")  
```

<br>

The repository is also saved to the location you specified, and you can navigate to it as you normally would in Finder or Windows Explorer: 

<br>

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/new_project6.png")  
```

<br>

Hooray!

### Inspect your local repo

TODO: rework. 

Let's notice a few things: 

First, our working directory is set to `~/github/r-workshop`, and `r-workshop` is also named in the top right hand corner.

Second, we have a Git tab in the top right pane! Let's click on it. 

<br>

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/new_project5_annotated.png")  
```

<br>

Our Git tab has 2 items:

- .gitignore file
- .Rproj file

These have been added to our repo by RStudio â€” we can also see them in the File pane in the bottom right of RStudio. These are helper files that RStudio has added to streamline our workflow with GitHub and R. We will talk about the .Rproj file soon, and we won't talk about the .gitignore file today. <!---TODO but it's for --->. One thing to note about these files is that they begin with a period (`.`) which means they are hidden files: they show up in the Files pane of RStudio but won't show up in your Finder.

Going back to the Git tab, both these files have little yellow icons with question marks `?`. This is GitHub's way of saying: "I am responsible for tracking everything that happens in this repo, but I'm not sure what is going on with these files yet. Do you want me to track them too?" 
Let's click the boxes next to each file. This is called staging a file: you are indicating that you want GitHub to track this file. You'll see that the question marks turn into an A because these are new files that have been added to your repo (automatically by RStudio, not by you). 

These are the codes RStudio uses to describe how the files are changed, (from the RStudio [cheatsheet](http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/rstudio-IDE-cheatsheet.pdf)):

<br>

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="40%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/commit_codes_added_modified.png")  
```

<br>


### Edit your README file

Let's also open up the README.md. We will edit the file and illustrate how GitHub tracks files that have been modified (to complement seeing how it tracks files that have been added. 

README files are common in programming; they are the first place that someone will look to see why code exists and how to run it. 

In my README, I'll write: 

```
This repo is for my analysis at RStudio::conf(2020). 
```

When I save this, notice how it shows up in my Git tab. It has a blue "M": GitHub is already tracking this file, and tracking it line-by-line, so it knows that something is different. 

Great. Let's walk through all the steps of Syncing back to GitHub. 


## Sync from RStudio (local) to GitHub (remote)

Syncing to GitHub.com means 4 steps: 

1. Pull
1. Stage
1. Commit
1. Push

<br>

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/commit_steps.png")  
```

<br>

We start off this whole process by clicking on the Commit section. 

TODO: image circling Commit 

### Pull 

We start off by "Pulling" from the remote repository (GitHub.com) to make sure that our local copy has the most up-to-date information that is available online. Right now, since we just created the repo and are the only ones that have permission to work on it, we can be pretty confident that there isn't new information availble. But we pull anyways because this is a very safe habit to get into for when you start collaborating with yourself across computers or others. Best practice is to pull often: it costs nothing (other than an internet connection). 

Pull by clicking the teal Down Arrow. 

TODO: redo figs
<br />
<br />

![](img/pull.png)
<br />
<br />

### Stage

Stage the files you want to commit.  We've already done this with our .Rproj and .gitignore files, but let's stage the README.md as well. 

Check the "Staged" boxes:

<br />

![](img/staged.png)
<br />
<br />

### Commit

TODO: text

<br />

![](img/commit.png)
<br />
<br />

### Push

TODO: text

<br />

![](img/push.png)
<br />

## Commit history

TODO: more, swap out images

The files you added should be on github.com:
<br />

![](img/Github_remote.png)
<br />
<br />

Let's also explore commit history, file history.

### READMEs on GitHub

Notice how the README.md file we created is automatically displayed at the bottom. Since it is good practice to have a README file that identifies what code does (i.e. why it exists), GitHub will display a Markdown file called README nicely formatted.

## Project-oriented workflows

This GitHub repository is now also an RStudio Project. This just means that RStudio has saved this additional file with extension `.Rproj` (ours is `r-workshop.Rproj`) to store specific settings for this project. It's a bit of technology to help us get into the good habit of having a project-oriented workflow. 

A [project-oriented workflow](https://rstats.wtf/project-oriented-workflow.html) means that we are going to organize all of the relevant things we need for our analyses in the same place. That means that this is the place where we keep all of our data, code, figures, notes, etc. 

R Projects are great for reproducibility, because our self-contained working directory will be the **first** place R looks for files. 

<!---
Why does this matter? It's convenient for us to have everything associated with our analyses close at-hand.  When we work with different files in R (like data or saved graphs) we always need to tell R where things "live" by identifying its file path. If files are scattered across your computer, we would have to keep track of many different filepaths. So using RStudio Projects and having a project-oriented workflow and mindset makes our analysis less brittle and more portable â€” across people, time, and computers.  

--->

### Working directory

Now that we have our Project, here is an important question: where are we? Now we are in our Project. Everything we do will by default be saved here so we can be nice and organized. 

And this is important because if Allison clones this repository that you just made and saves it in `Allison/my/projects/way/over/here`, she will still be able to interact with your files as you are here.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/RStudio_IDE_projdir.png")  
```

## Project-oriented workflows in action (aka our analytical setup)

Let's get a bit organized. First, let's create our a new R Markdown file where we will do our analyses. This will be nice because you can also write notes to yourself in this document. 

### Create a new Rmd file

So let's do this: 

File > New File > R Markdown ... (or click the green plus in the top left corner).

Let's set up this file so we can use it for the rest of the day. I'm going to update the header with a new title and add my name, and then I'm going to delete the rest of the document so that we have a clean start. 

> **Efficiency Tip**: I use Shift - Command - Down Arrow to highlight text from my cursor to the end of the document

```

title: "Creating charts in R with `ggplot2`"
author: "Julie Lowndes"
date: "01/27/2020"
output: html_document
---

# Plots with ggplot2

We are going to make plots in R and it's going to be amazing.

```

Now, let's save it. I'm going to call my file `plots-ggplot.Rmd`. 

Notice that when we save this file, it pops up in our Git tab. Git knows that there is something new in our repo. 

Let's also knit this file. And look: Git also sees the knitted .html. 


And let's practice syncing our file to to GitHub: pull, stage, commit, push

> **Troubleshooting:** What if a file doesn't show up in the Git tab and you expect that it should? Check to make sure you've saved the file. If the filename is red with an asterix, there have been changes since it was saved. Remember to save before syncing to GitHub!

### Create data and figures folders

Let's create a few folders to be organized. Let's have one for our the raw data, and one for the figures we will output. We can do this in RStudio, in the bottom right pane Files pane by clicking the New Folder button: 

* folder called "data"
* folder called "figures"  

We can press the refresh button in the top-right of this pane (next to the "More" button) to have these show up in alphabetical order. 

Now let's go to our Finder or Windows Explorer: our new folders are there as well!

### Move data files to data folder

You downloaded several files for this workshop from the [r-for-excel-data folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RywSUw8hxETlROdIhLIntxPsZq0tKSdS?usp=sharing), and we'll move these data into our repo now. These data files are a mix of comma separate value (CSV) files and some as Excel spreadsheets (.xlsx): 

- ca_np.csv 
- ci_np.xlsx
- fish.csv
- inverts.xlsx
- kelp.xlsx
- lobsters.xlsx
- lobsters2.xlsx
- noaa_fisheries.csv
- substrate.xlsx TODO delete?

Copy-paste or drag all of these files into the 'data' subfolder of your R project. Make sure you do not also copy the original folder; we don't need any subfolders in our data folder. 

Now let's go back to RStudio. We can click on the data folder in the Files tab and see them. 

The data folder also shows up in your Git tab. But the figures folder does not. That is because GitHub cannot track an empty folder, it can only track files within a folder. 

Let's Sync these files. We can stage multiple files at once by typing Command - A and clicking "Stage" (or using the space bar). To Sync: pull - stage - commit - push!


### Activity

Edit your README and practice syncing (pull, stage, commit, push). For example, 

```
"We use the following data from the Santa Barbara Coastal Term Ecological Research and National  Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in our analyses"
```

Explore your Commit History, and discuss with your neighbor. 

## Committing - how often? Tracking changes in your files

Whenever you make changes to the files in Github, you will walk through the Pull -> Stage -> Commit -> Push steps.

I tend to do this every time I finish a task (basically when I start getting nervous that I will lose my work).  Once something is committed, it is very difficult to lose it.


<!---
One thing that I love about about Github is that it is easy to see how files have changed over time.  Usually I compare commits through github.com:
<br />
<br />

![](img/commit_history.png)
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />


![](img/commit_compare_2.png)
<br />
<br />

You can click on the commits to see how the files changed from the previous commit:
<br />
<br />

![](img/commit_compare_3.png)
<br />
<br />

### END **GitHub** session!
