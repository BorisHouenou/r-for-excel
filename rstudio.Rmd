# R & RStudio, RMarkdown {#rstudio}

## Summary

We'll learn RMarkdown, which helps you tell a story with your data analysis because you can write text alongside the code. We are actually learning two languages at once: R and Markdown. 

### Objectives 

In this lesson we will:

- get oriented to the RStudio interface
- intro to RMarkdown
- functions, help pages
- packages
- error messages and commenting
- setup and configuration
  - install `here()` and `usethis` packages
  - configure Git 

- intro pipe operator (`%>%`)

## RStudio Orientation

Open RStudio for the first time. 

Launch RStudio/R.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/RStudio_IDE.png")  
```

Notice the default panes:

  * Console (entire left)
  * Environment/History (tabbed in upper right)
  * Files/Plots/Packages/Help (tabbed in lower right)

We won't click through this all immediately but we will become familiar with more of the options and capabilities throughout the next few days.

Something critical to know now is that you can make everything you see BIGGER by going to the navigation pane: View > Zoom In. Learn these keyboard shortcuts; being able to see what you're typing will help avoid typos & help us help you.

I think that **R is your airplane, and the RStudio IDE is your airport**. You are the pilot, and you use R to go places! With practice you'll gain skills and confidence; you can fly further distances and get through tricky situations. You will become an awesome pilot and can fly your plane anywhere. And the RStudio IDE provides support! Runways, communication, community, and other services that makes your life as a pilot much easier. It provides not only the infrastructure but a hub for the community that you can interact with. 

<!---
FYI: you can change the default location of the panes, among many other things: [Customizing RStudio](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200549016-Customizing-RStudio). 
--->

An important first question: **where are we?** 

If you've have opened RStudio for the first time, you'll be in your Home directory. This is noted by the `~/` at the top of the console. You can see too that the Files pane in the lower right shows what is in the Home directory where you are. You can navigate around within that Files pane and explore, but note that you won't change where you are: even as you click through you'll still be Home: `~/`. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/RStudio_IDE_homedir.png")  
```

We are going to have our first experience with R through RMarkdown, so let's do the following.

## Intro to RMarkdown

An RMarkdown file is a plain text file that allow us to write code and text together, and when it is "knit", the code will be evaluated and the text formatted so that it creates a reproducible report or document that is nice to read as a human.

This is really critical to reproducibility, and it also saves time. This document will recreate your figures for you in the same document where you are writing text. So no more doing analysis, saving a plot, pasting that plot into Word, redoing the analysis, re-saving, re-pasting, etc. 

Let's experience this a bit ourselves and then we'll talk about it more. 

### Create an RMarkdown file

Let's do this together:

File -> New File -> RMarkdown... (or alternatively you can click the green plus in the top left -> RMarkdown). 

Let's title it "Testing" and write our name as author, then click OK with the recommended Default Output Format, which is HTML.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rstudio_new-rmd-doc-html.png")  
```

OK, first off: by opening a file, we are seeing the 4th pane of the RStudio console, which is essentially a text editor. This lets us organize our files within RStudio instead of having a bunch of different windows open.

Let's have a look at this file — it's not blank; there is some initial text is already provided for you. Let's have a high-level look through of it: 

- The top part has the Title and Author we provided, as well as today's date and the output type as an HTML document like we selected above.
- There are white and grey sections. These are the 2 main languages that make up an RMarkdown file. 
  - **Grey sections are R code**
  - **White sections are Markdown text**
- There is black and blue text.  
  
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rmarkdown.png")  
```

### Knit your RMarkdown file

Let's go ahead and "Knit" by clicking the blue yarn at the top of the RMarkdown file. 
It's going to ask us to save first, I'll name mine "testing.Rmd". Note that this is by default going to save this file in your home directory `/~`. Since this is a testing document this is fine to save here; we will get more organized about where we save files very soon. Once you click Save, the knit process will be able to continue.

OK so how cool is this, we've just made an html file! This is a single webpage that we are viewing locally on our own computers. Knitting this RMarkdown document has rendered — we also say formatted — both the Markdown text (white) and the R code (grey), and the it also executed — we also say ran — the R code.  

Let's have a look at them side-by-side: 

<br>

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rmarkdown_side_by_side.png")  
```

Let's take a deeper look at these two files. So much of learning to code is looking for patterns.

#### Activity

Say hello to the person sitting next to you. Discuss what you see. 

### Markdown text

To warm us up for R, let's start by talking about another language, Markdown. This is a formatting language for plain text, and there are only about 15 rules to know. 

Notice the syntax for:

- **headers** get rendered at multiple levels: `#`, `##`
- **bold**: `**word**`

There are some good [cheatsheets](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Here-Cheatsheet) to get you started, and here is one built into RStudio: Go to Help > Markdown Quick Reference

<!---
#### Activity

1. In Markdown write some italic text, make a numbered list, and add a few subheaders.
 Use the Markdown Quick Reference (in the menu bar: Help > Markdown Quick Reference). 
1. Reknit your html file. 
--->

### R code

Let's look at the R code that we see executed in our knitted document. 

We see that `summary(cars)` produces a table

And we see that `plot(pressure)` produces a plot. 

`cars` and `pressure` are small datasets that come with R out-of-the-box. 

### Code chunks

R code is written in code chunks, which are grey. 
<!---There are two things to look at: R code chunks and code chunk options --->

Each of them start with 3 backticks and `{r label}`, which signify that there will be R code inside, and they are each given a unique name. Anything inside the brackets (`{ }`) is instructions for RMarkdown about that code to run. For example:

- the first chunk says `include=FALSE`, and we don't see it included in the HTML document. 
- the second chunk has no additional instructions, and in the HTML document we see the code and the evaluation of that code (a summary table)
- the third chunk says `echo=FALSE`, and in the HTML document we do not see the code echoed, we only see the plot when the code is executed.

There are many more options available and we will explore more as we go.

#### New code chunks

We can create a new chunk in your RMarkdown first in one of these ways: 

- click "Insert > R" at the top of the editor pane
- type by hand 
   \```{r}
   \```
- if you haven't deleted a chunk that came with the new file, edit that one

> Cool tip: doesn't have to be only R, other languages supported. 

Now, let's write some code in R. Let's say we want to plot the cars data. I'm going to press enter to to add some extra carriage returns because sometimes I find it easier to look at my code when there is a bit more space, and R lets you use as much whitespace as you would like.

```{r}

summary(pressure)

```

We can knit this and see the plot of cars. This is the same data that we made the summary table with. 

> Troubleshooting: If you could not successfully knit your document without error, Look at your code again. Do you have both open `(` and close `)` parentheses? Are your code chunk fences correct?

#### Code chunk labels

It is possible to label your code chunks. This is to help us navigate between them and keep them organized. In our example Rmd, our  three chunks say `r` as the language, and have a label (`setup`, `cars`, `pressure`). 

Labels are optional, but will become powerful as you become a powerful R user. But if you label your code chunks, you must have unique labels. We will explore this in a moment.

## R code in the Console

It is important to be able to run R code directly rather than only executing it when you knit the document. This is the live R process.

The Console (bottom left pane of the RStudio IDE) is where you can interact with the R engine and run code directly. 

Let's type this in the Console: `summary(pressure)`. We see the pressure summary table returned; it is the same information that we saw in our knitted html document. 

``` r
summary(pressure)
#>   temperature     pressure       
#>  Min.   :  0   Min.   :  0.0002  
#>  1st Qu.: 90   1st Qu.:  0.1800  
#>  Median :180   Median :  8.8000  
#>  Mean   :180   Mean   :124.3367  
#>  3rd Qu.:270   3rd Qu.:126.5000  
#>  Max.   :360   Max.   :806.0000
```

### Error messages

When you code in R or any language, you will encounter errors. We will discuss troubleshooting tips more deeply tomorrow in [Collaborating & getting help](#collaboration); here we will just get a little comfortable with them. 

#### R error messages

**Error messages are your friends**. 

What do they look like? I'll demo typing in the Console `summary(pressur)`

``` r
summary(pressur)
#> Error in summary(pressur): object 'pressur' not found
```

Remember that R is a language, not unsimilar to English! There are times you aren't understood -- it's going to happen. There are different ways this can happen. Sometimes you'll get an error. This is like someone saying 'What?' or 'Pardon'? Error messages can also be more useful, like when they say 'I didn't understand what you said, I was expecting you to say blah'. 

In this case, R is saying "What? I didn't understand `pressur`". 

Errors will be less frustrating if you have the understanding and mindset that **most likely the problem is your typo or misuse**, and not that R is broken or hates you. The first step of becoming a proficent R user is to move past the exasperation of "it's not working!" and **read the error message**. 

You'll see that when you ask us for help, we will start off by reading the error message. 

<!---
And also know that there are errors that can creep in more subtly, when you are giving information that is understood, but not in the way you meant. Like if I am telling a story about suspenders that my British friend hears but silently interprets in a very different way (true story). This can leave me thinking I've gotten something across that the listener (or R) might silently interpreted very differently. And as I continue telling my story you get more and more confused... Clear communication is critical when you code: write clean, well documented code and check your work as you go to minimize these circumstances!

--->

#### RMarkdown error messages

Errors can also occur in RMarkdown. I said a moment ago that you label your code chunks, they need to be unique. Let's see what happens if not. If I (re)name our `summary(pressure)` chunk to "pressure", I will see an error when you try to knit: 

```
processing file: testing.Rmd
Error in parse_block(g[-1], g[1], params.src) : duplicate label 'cars'
Calls: <Anonymous> ... process_file -> split_file -> lapply -> FUN -> parse_block
Execution halted
```

There are 2 things I want to say about this. 

First: This error message starts out in a pretty cryptic way: I don't know what `parse_block(g[-1]...` means. But, assuming that the error message is really trying to help me, I continue scanning the message which allows me to identify the problem: "duplicate label 'cars'". 

Second: This error is in the "R Markdown" tab on the bottom left of the RStudio IDE; it is not in the Console. That is because when RMarkdown is knitted, it actually spins up an R workspace separately from what is passed to the Console; this is one of the ways that R Markdown enables reproducibility because it is a self-contained instance of R. 

You can click back and forth between the Console and the R Markdown tab; this is something to look out for as we continue. Let's click back to Console now. 

### Running code chunks in the Console

From RStudio, there are several ways to get R code from a RMarkdown chunk (the grey R code) down into the console. How do we do it? There are several ways. Let's do each of these with `summary(cars)`.

1. copy-paste the `summary(cars)` code into the console.
   a. important!!: I am only highlighting `summary(cars)`, not any of the backticks! If you see the error ````{r}`Error: attempt to use zero-length variable name
1. select the line (or simply put the cursor there), and click 'Run'. This is available from 
    a. the bar above the file (green arrow)
    b. the menu bar: Code > Run Selected Line(s)
    c. keyboard shortcut: command-return
1. click the green arrow at the right of the code chunk

### File vs. Console

When should you write code in a file (.Rmd or .R script) and when should you write it in the Console? 

We write things in the file that are necessary for our analysis and that we want to preserve for reproducibility; we will be doing this throughout the workshop to give you a good sense of this.

The Console is good for doing quick calculations like `8*22.3`, testing functions, for calling help pages, for installing packages. We'll explore these things next. 


## R functions

Like Excel, the power of R comes not from doing small operations individually (like `8*22.3`). R's power comes from being able to operate on whole suites of numbers and datasets. 

Like Excel, some of the biggest power in R is that there are built-in functions that you can use in your analyses (and, as we'll see, R users can easily create and share functions, and it is this open source developer and contributor community that makes R so awesome).

R has a mind-blowing collection of built-in functions that are used with the same syntax: function name with parentheses around what the function needs to do what it is supposed to do.

We've seen a few functions already: we've seen `plot()` and `summary()`. 

Functions always have the same structure: a name, parentheses, and arguments that you can specify. `function_name(arguments)`. 

> Aside: some functions don't require arguments: try typing `date()` into the Console. Be sure to type the parentheses (`date()`); otherwise R will return the code behind the `date()` function rather than the output that you want/expect.

<!---
`function_name(argument1 = value1, argument2 = value2, ...)`. When you see this syntax, we say we are "calling the function".
--->

So with the `plot()` function, it requires data you'd like to plot. Let's have a deeper look at the arguments for `plot()`, using the help pages. 

## Help pages
 
Every function available to you should have a help page, and you access it by typing a question mark preceding the function name in the Console. 

```
?plot
```

This opens up the correct page in the Help Tab in the bottom-right of the RStudio IDE. You can also click on the tab and type in the function name in the search bar. 

All help pages will have the same format, here is how I look at it: 

The help page tells the name of the package in the top left, and broken down into sections:

 - Description: An extended description of what the function does.
 - Usage: The arguments of the function and their default values.
 - Arguments: An explanation of the data each argument is expecting.
 - Details: Any important details to be aware of.
 - Value: The data the function returns.
 - See Also: Any related functions you might find useful.
 - Examples: Some examples for how to use the function.

When I look at a help page, I start with the description to see if I am in the right place for what I need to do. Reading the description for `plot` lets me know that yup, this is the function I want.

I next look at the usage and arguments, which give me a more concrete view into what the function does. `plot` requires arguments for `x` and `y` — and when we pass `cars` to `plot()`, R is able to understand that it should use the two columns in that dataset as x and y. The `...` means that there are many other things we can pass to `plot()`, which we can understand here to be about the style of the plots

Then, I usually scroll down to the bottom to the examples. This is where I can actually see how the function is used, and I can also paste those examples into the Console to see their output. Let's try it:

```{r plot-help-example}
plot(sin, -pi, 2*pi)
```

Let's try another function. In Excel, there is a "SUM" function to calculate a total. There is the same function in R, but it is spelled with all lowercase letters: `sum()`. 

Let's calculate the sum of all the distances traveled in the `cars` dataset. We specify a single column of a dataset using the `$` operator:

```{r sum-cars, eval=FALSE}
sum(cars$dist)
```

Let's do another: try using `c()` which combines values together. 

So let's create a new R code chunk. And we'll write: 

```{r c-example}
c(1, 7:9)
```

So you can see that this combines these values all into the same place, which is called a vector here. But let's learn more about what this does. 

## Commenting

I've been working in the Console to illustrate working interactively with the live R process. But it is likely that you may want to write some of these things as notes in your R Markdown file. That's great! 

But you may not want everything you type to be run when you knit your document. So you can tell R not to run something by "commenting it out". This is done with one or more pound/hash/number signs: `#`. So if I wanted to write a note to myself about using `?` to open the help pages, I would write this in my R Markdown code chunk: 

```{r commenting}
## open help pages with ?:
# ?plot
```

RStudio color-codes comments as green so they are easier to see. 

Notice that my convention is to use two `##`'s for my notes, and only one for the code that I don't want to run now, but might want to run other times. I like this convention because in RStudio you can uncomment/recomment mulitiple lines of code at once if you use just one `#`: do this by going to the menu Code > Comment/Uncomment Lines (keyboard shortcut on my Mac: Shift-Command-C).

Note also that the hashtag `#` is used differently in Markdown and in R: 

- in R, a hashtag indicates a comment that will not be evaluated. You can use as many as you want: `#` is equivalent to `######`.
- in Markdown, a hashtag indicates a level of a header. And the number you use matters: `#` is a "level one header", meaning the biggest font and the top of the hierarchy. `###` is a level three header, and will show up nested below the `#` and `##` headers.

## Assigning objects with `<-`

In Excel, data are stored in the spreadsheet. In R, they are stored in objects. Data can be a variety of formats, like numeric and text.  

We will be working with data objects that are rectangular in shape. If they only have one column or one row, they are also called a vector. And we assign these objects names. 

This is a big difference with Excel, where you usually identify data by its location on the grid, like `$A1:D$20`. (You can do this with Excel by naming ranges of cells, but many people don’t do this.)

We assign an object a name by writing the name along with the assignment operator `<-`. Let's go back to our example about calculating the sum of the distance traveled by cars. 

```{r assign}
sum_dist <- sum(cars$dist)
```

In my head I hear "sum_dist gets `r sum(cars$dist)`". 

And we can execute it by sending it to the Console. 

Object names can be whatever you want, although they cannot start with a digit and cannot contain certain other characters such as a comma or a space. Different folks have different conventions; you will be wise to adopt a [convention for demarcating words](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case) in names.

```

## R Packages

So far we've been using a couple functions from base R, such as `plot()` and `c()`. But, one of the amazing things about R is that a vast user community is always creating new functions and packages that expand R's capabilities.  

In R, the fundamental unit of shareable code is the package. A package bundles together code, data, documentation (including to create the help pages), and tests, and is easy to share with others. They increase the power of R by improving existing base R functionalities, or by adding new ones. 

The traditional place to download packages is from CRAN, the [Comprehensive R Archive Network](https://cran.r-project.org/), which is where you downloaded R. CRAN is like a grocery store for vetted R packages.

<!---You can also install packages from GitHub, which we'll do tomorrow.--->

You don't need to go to CRAN's website to install packages, this can be accomplished within R using the command `install.packages("package-name-in-quotes")`. 

Let's install several packages that we will be using shortly. Write this in your R Markdown document and run it: 

```{r install-usethis, eval=FALSE}
## setup packages
install.packages("usethis")
```


And after you run it, comment it out: 

```{r install-usethis2, eval=FALSE}
## setup packages
# install.packages("usethis")
```

Now we've installed the package, but we need to tell R that we are going to use the functions within the `usethis` package. We do this by using the function `library()`.

In my mind, this is analogous to needing to wire your house for electricity: this is something you do once; this is `install.packages`. But then you need to turn on the lights each time you need them (R Session).

It's a nice convention to do this on the same line as your commented-out `install.packages()` line; this makes it easier for someone (including you in a future time or computer) to install the package easily. 

```{r install-usethis3}
## setup packages
library(usethis) # install.packages("usethis")
```

When `usethis` is successfully attached, you won't get any feedback in the Console. So unless you get an error, this worked for you.

Now let's do the same with the `here` package.

```{r}
library(here) # install.packages("here")
# here() starts at /Users/lowndes
```

`here` also successfully attached but isn't quiet about it. It is a "chatty" package; when we attached it did so, and responded with the filepath where we are working from. This is the same as `~/` which we saw earlier. 

<!---
We can now go to the Packages tab in the bottom-right of the RStudio IDE, and find that `here` is a package installed in our system. Click on `here` to open the Help tab, listing all of the functions within this package. 
--->

Finally, let's install the `tidyverse` package.

```{r install-tidyverse}
# install.packages("tidyverse")
```

"The tidyverse is a coherent system of packages for data manipulation, exploration and visualization that share a common design philosophy." - Joseph Rickert:[What is the tidyverse?](https://rviews.rstudio.com/2017/06/08/what-is-the-tidyverse/), RStudio Community Blog.

This may take a little while to complete so while it is running let's discuss the pipe operator `%>%`, which will be installed along with the tidyverse. 

## The pipe operator  `%>%`

We will be using the pipe operator as we wrangle data in future sessions, but we wanted to discuss it a bit here. It helps you turn your data analysis into a readable story.

Let's look at an example that we will have completed by the end of tomorrow: 

TODO: MAYBE AS SLIDES?

Let's say our analytical task is to XYZ.

Here is how we could tell this as a story: 

- We took the data about how many fish were landed and then
- We filtered


state_value <- landings_tidy %>% 
  filter(year %in% c(2015)) %>% 
  group_by(state) %>% 
  summarize(
    state_value = sum(dollars_num, na.rm = TRUE),
    state_landings = sum(landings_pounds, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>% 
  arrange(-state_value) %>% 
  head(5)

## Setup Git & GitHub

Before we break, we are going to set up Git and GitHub which we will be using along with R and RStudio for the rest of the workshop. You are welcome to leave as soon as you have this set up We are doing this now so that if you have trouble please stay a few extra minutes.

This set up is a one-time thing! You will only have to do this once per computer. We'll walk through this together. 

1. We will use the `usethis` package to configure **git** with global commands, which means it will apply 'globally' to all files on your computer, rather than to a specific folder. 

Since we already installed and attached it, type this into your Console: 

```{r usethis, eval=FALSE}

use_git_config(user.name = "jules32", user.email = "jules32@example.org")

```

### Ensure that Git/GitHub/RStudio are communicating

TODO: should this be from [Allison's googledoc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zx2upJJqFZe94O3BQSMI56Z76s3haLXC0otKSpcZaJQ/edit)


### BACKUP PLAN for configuration

If `usethis` fails, the following is the classic approach to configuring **git**.  Open the Git Bash program (Windows) or the Terminal (Mac) and type the following:

        # display your version of git
        git --version
        
        # replace USER with your Github user account
        git config --global user.name USER
        
        # replace NAME@EMAIL.EDU with the email you used to register with Github
        git config --global user.email NAME@EMAIL.EDU
        
        # list your config to confirm user.* variables set
        git config --list

Not only have you just set up git as a one-time-only thing, you have just used the command line. We don't have time to learn much of the command line today, but you just successfully used it following explicit instructions, which is huge! There are great resources for learning the command line, check out [this tutorial from SWC at UCSB](http://remi-daigle.github.io/2016-04-15-UCSB/shell/). 

#### Troubleshooting

If you have problems setting up git, please see the [Troubleshooting section](http://happygitwithr.com/troubleshooting.html) in Jenny Bryan's amazing [HappyGitWithR](http://happygitwithr.com). 

##### New(ish) Error on a Mac
We've also seen the following errors from RStudio: 

```
error key does not contain a section --global terminal
```
and
```
fatal: not in a git directory
```

To solve this, go to the Terminal and type:
    ```
which git
```

<img src="img/git_whichgit.png" width="250px">

  
Look at the filepath that is returned. Does it say anything to do with Apple?

-> If yes, then the [Git you downloaded](https://git-scm.com/downloads) isn't installed, please redownload if necessary, and follow instructions to install.  

-> If no, (in the example image, the filepath does not say anything with Apple) then proceed below:

In RStudio, navigate to: Tools > Global Options > Git/SVN. 

<img src="img/git_options.png" width="250px">


<br>

Does the **“Git executable”** filepath match what the url in Terminal says? 

<br>

<img src="img/git_options_filepath.png" width="500px">


If not, click the browse button and navigate there.   

>*Note*: on my laptop, even though I navigated to /usr/local/bin/git, it then automatically redirect because /usr/local/bin/git was an alias on my computer. That is fine. Click OK.


### END **RStudio/RMarkdown** session!
