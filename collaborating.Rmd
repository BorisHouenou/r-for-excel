# Collaborating & Getting Help {#collaborating}
rstats community coding 

## Summary

By being here at RStudio::conf and in this workshop, you are already part of the R community. We will discuss additional R communtities, how to engage, and how to ask for help. 

*TODO: refine* Main purpose: work better with colleagues, help you help yourself. A big theme of this workshop has been how to more seamlessly collaborate with each other.

The collaborative power of GitHub and RStudio is really game changing. So far we've been collaborating with our most important collaborator: ourselves. But, we are lucky that in science we have so many other collaborators, so let's learn how to accelerate our collaborations with them through GitHub! 

We are going to teach you the simplest way to collaborate with someone, which is for both of you to have privileges to edit and add files to a repository. GitHub is built for software developer teams, and there is a lot of features that limit who can directly edit files, but we don't need to start there. 

We will do this all with a partner, and we'll walk through some things all together, and then give you a chance to work with your collaborator on your own.

## R communities 

We are going to switch gears for a moment and talk about communities that exist around R and how you can engage with them. 

R connects us online and in person, and by being here at RStudio::conf, you are a part of it. 

One thing about the R community is that we use Twitter as a platform to connect with each other. Yes, Twitter is a legit tool for data science. Most communities have some degree of in-person and online presence, with Twitter being a big part of that online presence. We are going to talk about how you can start using it as a tool next, but first I want to show you who some of these communities you might want to engage with are.

This is a small sampling to give you a sense of a few communities. Please see Thomas Mock's presentation [Finding the YOU in the R community](https://github.com/jthomasmock/presentations/blob/master/r-community2.pdf) for more details.

### RStudio Community



### R User Groups

R User Groups ("RUGs") are in-person meetups supported by [The R Consortium](https://www.r-consortium.org/projects/r-user-group-support-program). See a [list of RUGs and conferences](https://jumpingrivers.github.io/meetingsR/r-user-groups.html).

### RLadies

## How to use Twitter for \#rstats

Twitter is a legit tool for R. It's how we connect with other R users, learn from each other, develop together, and become friends. 

### Interpreting an \#rstats tweet

Here are a few examples to show how I use Twitter to learn new things and keep tabs on (some of!) what's going on in R. I miss a lot because I'm not on Twitter all the time. And that is OK. There is too much goodness to know it all, and I am by no stretch of the imagination on top of it all or experienced with everything folks are developing. But, I learn more than I would if I were never on Twitter. Also, you can always look back at past users and hashtags and get "news updates" as you please. The search feature is pretty good!

<br>

When I saw [this tweet](https://twitter.com/Md_Harris/status/1074469302974193665/photo/1) by [@Md_Harris](https://twitter.com/Md_Harris), this was my internal monologue: 

1. Cool visualization!
1. I want to represent my data this way
1. He includes his [code](https://gist.github.com/mrecos) that I can look at to understand what he did, and I can run and remix
1. The package is from [@sckottie](https://twitter.com/sckottie) — I know he is at [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org), which is a really amazing software developer community for science
1. [`rnoaa`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rnoaa/index.html) is a package making NOAA [US environmental] data more accessible! I didn't know about this, it will be so useful for my colleagues
1. I will retweet so my network can benefit as well

<br>

Another example, [this tweet](https://twitter.com/JennyBryan/status/1074339217986138113) where [@JennyBryan](https://twitter.com/JennyBryan/) is asking for feedback on a super useful package for interfacing between R and excel: [`readxl`](https://readxl.tidyverse.org/).

<br>

<center>
  <a><img src="/img/blog/keynote/tweet-jennybryan-readxl.png" width="400px"></a>
</center>

<br>


My internal monologue: 

1. Yay, readxl is awesome, and also getting better
1. Do I have any spreadsheets to contribute? 
1. In any case, I will retweet so others can contribute. And I'll like it too because I appreciate this work

### How to Twitter

My advice for Twitter is to start off small and deliberately. Curate who you follow and what you say: although I have many interests beyond R, I use Twitter deliberately for R and science communities.

Use it to listen and learn, and then you can gradually build up the courage to like and retweet things. And remember that liking and retweeting is not only a way to engage with the community yourself, but it is also a way to welcome and amplify other people.   

If you're joining twitter to learn R, I suggest following:

- [@hadleywickham](https://twitter.com/hadleywickham) 
- [@JennyBryan](https://twitter.com/JennyBryan), 
- [@rOpenSci](https://twitter.com/ropensci), 
- [@WeAreRLadies](https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/WeAreRLadies). 

Listen to what they say and who joins those conversations, and follow other people and organizations. You could also look at who they are following. Also, check out the [#rstats](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rstats&src=typed_query) hashtag. This is not something that you can follow (although you can have it as a column in software like TweetDeck), but you can search it and you'll see that the people you follow use it to help tag conversations. You'll find other useful tags as well, within your domain, as well as other R-related interests, e.g. [#rspatial](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rspatial&src=typed_query). When I read marine science papers, I see if the authors are on Twitter; I sometimes follow them, ask them questions, or just tell them I liked their work!

You can also follow us: 

- [@juliesquid](https://twitter.com/juliesquid)
- [@allison_horst](https://twitter.com/allison_horst)
- [@jafflerbach](https://twitter.com/jafflerbach)
- [@ECOuture9](https://twitter.com/ECOuture9)

<br>

These are just a few ways to learn and build community on Twitter. And as you feel comfortable, you can start sharing your ideas or your links too. Live-tweeting is a really great way to engage as well, and bridge in-person conferences with online communities. And of course, in addition to engaging on Twitter, check whether there are local RLadies chapters or other R meetups, and join! Or perhaps [start one](https://openscapes.org/blog/2018/11/16/how-to-start-a-coding-club/)?


## Getting help: help you help yourself

So Twitter is a place to engage with folks and learn, and while it is also a place to ask questions, there are other places to look first, depending on your question. 

We're going to talk about how to ask for help, how to interpret responses, and how to act upon the help you receive.

### Read the error message

They may be red, they may be unfamiliar, but **error messages are your friends**. There are multiple types of messages that R will print. Read the message to figure out what it’s trying to tell you. 

**Error:** There’s a fatal error in your code that prevented it from being run through successfully. You need to fix it for the code to run. 

**Warning:** Non-fatal errors (don’t stop the code from running, but this is a potential problem that you should know about).

**Message:** Here’s some helpful information about the code you just ran (you can hide these if you want to)

<!---

Remember that this is a language, not unsimilar to English! There are times you aren't understood -- it's going to happen. There are different ways this can happen. Sometimes you'll get an error. This is like someone saying 'What?' or 'Pardon'? Error messages can also be more useful, like when they say 'I didn't understand what you said, I was expecting you to say blah'. That is a great type of error message. Error messages are your friend. Google them (copy-and-paste!) to figure out what they mean. 

And also know that there are errors that can creep in more subtly, when you are giving information that is understood, but not in the way you meant. Like if I am telling a story about suspenders that my British friend hears but silently interprets in a very different way (true story). This can leave me thinking I've gotten something across that the listener (or R) might silently interpreted very differently. And as I continue telling my story you get more and more confused... Clear communication is critical when you code: write clean, well documented code and check your work as you go to minimize these circumstances!

--->

The first thing to do with any error message is read it. Yes it's in angry red text and it's unexpected — but most error messages are doing their best to help you solve the problem. And you'll get more familiar with they way they tell you. Here are a few examples: 

#### If R...can’t find a function that you know exists:

**Symptom**: `‘Error in _________: could not find function “_________”`

**Likely diagnoses:**

- The library containing the function you’re trying to use hasn’t been attached
- You’ve misspelled or mistyped the function name

**Possible solutions:**

- Make sure you’ve attached the required package with library(package_name) - and remember this line should exist in your script before the code that uses a function from that package
- Make sure you’ve run the line of code that attaches the necessary package
- Check the function spelling/formatting very carefully
 
 
#### If R...can’t find an object (e.g. an object or variable) that you know you’ve stored: 

**Symptom:** `‘Error in ____ : object ‘_____’ not found’`

**Likely diagnoses:**

- The object hasn’t been created or stored
- You’ve mistyped the object name

**Possible solutions:**

- Make sure you’ve run the line(s) of code where you read-in or create the object
- Make sure you’ve spelled/typed the object name exactly as it exists in the Environment
- Use ls() to check which objects exist in your current workspace (and if it’s not there, then it hasn’t been created/stored yet)

 
### Googling

Just as important as Googling your error message is being able to identify a useful result. 

**Check the date, check the source, check the relevance.** Is this a modern solution, or one from 2013? Do I trust the person responding? Is this about my question or on a different topic?

You will see links from many places, particularly: 

- RStudio Community 
- Stack Overflow
- Books, blogs, and tutorials
- GitHub Issues

We haven't talked about GitHub Issues yet: let's do an example. 

TODO: google/issues example

### Create a reprex

- [reprex.tidyverse.org](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/)
- [Jenny Bryan's reprex webinar](https://resources.rstudio.com/webinars/help-me-help-you-creating-reproducible-examples-jenny-bryan)

Jenny Bryan made `reprex` because "conversations about code are more productive with: code that ***actually runs***, that ***I don’t have to run***, and that ***I can easily run***".

Let me demo an example. This is Jenny's summary of what I'll do:
<br>

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/reprex-bryan.png")  
```

`reprex` is part of the Tidyverse, so we all already have it installed, but we do need to attach it: 

```{r reprex-attach}
library(reprex)
```

First I'll type into our RMarkdown script: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
ggplot(cars, aes(speed, dist)) +
  geom_point(color = "maroon")
```

And then when I also have this in my clipboard. Now I am going to paste it into an Issue for this repository. 

When I paste it: 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/reprex-ex-ggplot.png")  
```

Notice that following the backticks, there is only `r`, not `r{}`. This is because what we have pasted is formatted for R, not to be executed by R through RMarkdown. 

I can click on the Preview button in the Issues to see how this will render: and it will show my code, nicely formatted for R. 

**`reprex` is a "workflow package"**. That means that it's something we don't put in Rmds, scripts, or anything else. We use is in the Console when we are preparing to ask for help — from ourselves or someone else. 

reprex includes the output — experienced programmers who you might be asking for help can often read your code and know where the problem lies, especially when they can see the output. 

### Activity: "do it with iris"

Make a reprex and paste it in your Issues

### TODO Sync with your partner

## Collaborate with GitHub

### Create and clone a repo
TODO text

### Create repo (Partner 1)

Team up with a partner sitting next to you. Partner 1 will create a new repository. We will do this in the same way that we did in Chapter \@ref(github): [Create a repository on Github.com]. 

Let's name it `r-collab`. 

### Create a gh-pages branch (Partner 1)

We aren't going to talk about branches very much, but they are a powerful feature of git/GitHub. I think of it as creating a copy of your work that becomes a parallel universe that you can modify safely because it's not affecting your original work. And then you can choose to merge the universes back together if and when you want. By default, when you create a new repo you begin with one branch, and it is named `master`. When you create new branches, you can name them whatever you want. However, if you name one `gh-pages` (all lowercase, with a `-` and no spaces), this will let you create a website. And that's our plan. So, Partner 1, do this to create a `gh-pages` branch: 

On the homepage for your repo on GitHub.com, click the button that says "Branch:master". Here, you can switch to another branch (right now there aren't any others besides `master`), or create one by typing a new name. 

<img src="img/github-branch.png" width="350px">

<br>

Let's type `gh-pages`. 

<br>

<img src="img/github_create-branch_gh-pages.png" width="350px"> 

Let's also change `gh-pages` to the default branch and delete the master branch: this will be a one-time-only thing that we do here: 

First click to control branches:

<img src="img/github-branch2.png" width="350px"> 

And then click to change the default branch to `gh-pages`. I like to then delete the `master` branch when it has the little red trash can next to it. It will make you confirm that you really want to delete it, which I do!

<img src="img/github-change-branch.png" width="450px"> 


### Give your collaborator administration privileges (Partner 1 and 2)

Now, Partner 1, go into Settings > Collaborators > enter Partner 2's (your collaborator's) username. 

Partner 2 then needs to check their email and accept as a collaborator. Notice that your collaborator has "Push access to the repository" (highlighted below):

<img src="img/github_collab.png" width="450px"> 

### Clone to a new R Project  (Partner 1)

Now let's have Partner 1 clone the repository to their local computer. We'll do this through RStudio like we did before (see Chapter \@ref(github): [Clone your repository using RStudio]), but with a final additional step before hitting "Create Project": select "Open in a new Session".

<br>

<img src="img/github_clone_newproject.png" width="450px"> 

<br>
<br>
Opening this Project in a new Session opens up a new world of awesomeness from RStudio. Having different RStudio project sessions allows you to keep your work separate and organized. So you can collaborate with this collaborator on this repository while also working on your other repository from this morning. I tend to have a lot of projects going at one time:

<br>

![](img/Rproj_screenshot.jpg)

<br>

Have a look in your git tab. 

Like we saw this morning, when you first clone a repo through RStudio, RStudio will add an `.Rproj` file to your repo. And if you didn't add a `.gitignore` file when you originally created the repo on GitHub.com, RStudio will also add this for you. So, Partner 1, let's go ahead and sync this back to GitHub.com. 

Remember: 

![](img/commit_overview.png)

<br> 

Let's confirm that this was synced by looking at GitHub.com again. You may have to refresh the page, but you should see this commit where you added the `.Rproj` file.

### Clone to a new R Project  (Partner 2)

Now it's Partner 2's turn! Partner 2, clone this repository following the same steps that Partner 1 just did. When you clone it, RStudio should not create any new files — why? Partner 1 already created and pushed the `.Rproj` and `.gitignore` files so they already exist in the repo.  

### Create data folder (Partner 2)

Partner 2, let's create a folder for our data and store our `noaa_fisheries.csv` there. 

And now let's sync back to GitHub. 

![](img/commit_overview.png)


<br>

When we inspect on GitHub.com, click to view all the commits, you'll see commits logged from both Partner 1 and 2!

> Question: Would you still be able clone a repository that you are not a collaborator on? What do you think would happen? Try it! Can you sync back? 

### State of the Repository

OK, so where do things stand right now? GitHub.com has the most recent versions of all the repository's files. Partner 2 also has these most recent versions locally. How about Partner 1? 

Partner 1 does not have the most recent versions of everything on their computer. 

Question: How can we change that? Or how could we even check? 

Answer: PULL. 

Let's have Partner 1 go back to RStudio and Pull. If their files aren't up-to-date, this will pull the most recent versions to their local computer. And if they already did have the most recent versions? Well, pulling doesn't cost anything (other than an internet connection), so if everything is up-to-date, pulling is fine too. 

I recommend pulling every time you come back to a collaborative repository. Whether you haven't opened RStudio in a month or you've just been away for a lunch break, pull. It might not be necessary, but it can save a lot of heartache later.

## Merge conflicts

TODO: clarify that first when you pull it's because unstaged.

What kind of heartache are we talking about? Let's explore. **Stop and watch me create and solve a merge conflict with my Partner 2, and then you will have time to recreate this with your partner.** Here's what I am going to do:

Within a file, GitHub tracks changes line-by-line. So you can also have collaborators working on different lines within the same file and GitHub will be able to weave those changes into each other -- that's it's job! It's when you have collaborators working on *the same lines within the same file* that you can have **merge conflicts**. Merge conflicts can be frustrating, but they are actually trying to help you (kind of like R's error messages). They occur when GitHub can't make a decision about what should be on a particular line and needs a human (you) to decide. And this is good -- you don't want GitHub to decide for you, it's important that you make that decision. 

So let's test this. Let's have both Partners 1 and 2 go to RStudio and pull so you have the most recent versions of all your files. Now, Partners 1 and 2, both go to the README, and on Line 7, write something, anything. I'm not going to give any examples because I want both Partners to write something different. And be sure to save the README. 

OK. Now, let's have Partner 2 sync: pull, stage, commit, push. Great. 

Now, when Partner 2 is done, let's have Partner 1 (me) try. 

Partner 1: pull ---- Error! Merge conflict!

![](img/github_mergeconflict.png)

So Partner 1 is not allowed to pull, it failed. GitHub is protecting Partner 1 because if they did successfully pull, their work would be overwritten by whatever Partner 2 had written. So GitHub is going to make a human (Partner 1 in this case) decide. GitHub says, either commit this work first, or "stash it" (I interpret that as saving a copy of the README in another folder somewhere outside of this GitHub repository). 

Let's follow their advice and have Partner 1 commit. Great. Now let's pull again. 

Still not happy!

![](img/github_mergeconflict2.png)

<br>

OK, actually, we're just moving along this same problem that we know that we've created: Both Partner 1 and 2 have both added new information to the same line. You can see that the pop-up box is saying that there is a CONFLICT and the merge has not happened. OK. We can close that window and inspect. 

Notice that in the git tab, there are orange `U`s; this means that there is an unresolved conflict, and it is not staged with a check anymore because modifications have occurred to the file since it has been staged. 

Let's look at the README file itself. We got a preview in the diff pane that there is some new text going on in our README file: 

```r
<<<<<<< HEAD
Julie is collaborating on this README.
=======
**Jamie is adding lines here.**
>>>>>>> 05a189b23372f0bdb5b42630f8cb318003cee19b
```

In this example, Partner 1 is Jamie and Partner 2 is Julie. GitHub is displaying the line that Julie wrote and the line Jamie wrote separated by `=======`. So these are the two choices that Partner 2 has to decide between, which one do you want to keep? Where where does this decision start and end? The lines are bounded by `<<<<<<<HEAD` and `>>>>>>>long commit identifier`. 

So, to resolve this merge conflict, Partner 2 has to chose, and delete everything except the line they want. So, they will delete the `<<<<<<HEAD`, `=====`, `>>>>long commit identifier` and one of the lines that they don't want to keep. 

Do that, and let's try again. In this example, we've kept Jamie's line: 

![](img/github_mergeconflict3.png)

<br>

Then be sure to stage, and write a commit message. I often write "resolving merge conflict" or something so I know what I was up to. When I stage the file, notice how now my edits look like a simple line replacement (compare with the image above before it was re-staged): 

![](img/github_mergeconflict4.png)

### Your turn

Create a merge conflict with your partner, like we did in the example above. And try other ways to get and solve merge conflicts. For example, when you get the following error message, try both ways (commit or stash. Stash means copy/move it somewhere else, for example, on your Desktop temporarily).

![](img/github_mergeconflict.png)

### How do you avoid merge conflicts?

I'd say pull often, commit and sync often. 

Also, talk with your collaborators. Although our Ocean Health Index project is highly collaborative, we are actually rarely working on the exact same file at any given time. And if we are, we are also on Slack, Gchat, or sitting next to the person. 

But merge conflicts will occur and some of them will be heartbreaking and demoralizing. They happen to me when I collaborate with myself between my work computer and laptop. So protect yourself by pulling and syncing often! 


## Create your collaborative website

OK. Let's have both Partners create a new RMarkdown file and name it `my_name_fisheries.Rmd`. Here's what you will do: 

1. Pull!
1. Create a new RMarkdown file **and name it `my_name_fisheries.Rmd`**. Let's do it all lowercase. These will become pages for our website! 
1. Maybe change the title inside the Rmd, call it "My Name's Fisheries Analysis"
1. Knit!
1. Save and sync your .Rmd and your .html files 
    - (pull, stage, commit, pull, push)
1. Go to GitHub.com and go to your rendered website! Where is it? Figure out your website's url from your github repo's url. For example: 
    - my github repo: <https://github.com/jules32/r-collab>
    - my website url: <https://jules32.github.io/r-collab/>
    - note that the url starts with my **username.github.io**
    
So cool! On websites, if something is called `index.html`, that defaults to the home page. So <https://jules32.github.io/r-collab/> is the same as <https://jules32.github.io/r-collab/index.html>. If you name your RMarkdown file `my_research.Rmd`, the url will become <https://jules32.github.io/r-collab/my_research.html>.


## Issues

TODO: redo

Now let's have a look at issues. This is a way you can communicate to others about plans for the repo, questions, etc. Note that issues are public if the repository is public.

![](img/github-issues.png)

Let's create a new issue with the title "NYC flights". 

In the text box, let's write a note to our collaborator. You can use Markdown in this text box, which means all of your header and bullet formatting will come through. You can also select these options by clicking them just above the text box. 

Let's have one of you write something here. I'm going to write: 

```
Hi @jafflerbach! 

# first priority

- explore NYC flights
- plot interesting things
```

Note that I have my collaborator's GitHub name with a `@` symbol. This is going to email her directly so that she sees this issue. I can click the "Preview" button at the top left of the text box to see how this will look rendered in Markdown. It looks good! 

Now let's click submit new issue. 

On the right side, there are a bunch of options for categorizing and organizing your issues. You and your collaborator may want to make some labels and timelines, depending on the project. 

Another feature about issues is whether you want any notifications to this repository. Click where it says "Unwatch" up at the top. You'll see three options: "Not watching", "Watching", and "Ignoring". By default, you are watching these issues because you are a collaborator to the repository. But if you stop being a big contributor to this project, you may want to switch to "Not watching". Or, you may want to ask an outside person to watch the issues. Or you may want to watch another repo yourself!

![](img/github-collab.png)

Let's have Person 2 respond to the issue affirming the plan.


### END **collaborating** session!
